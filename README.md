# usrchk
minecraft username checker

Not very efficent, open to help and ways to speed up the program. 

Please follow the format that is in the example wordlist in the wordlists folder.
Some usernames that are blocked may show up as available, so be wary of that. 

To run the program, set a wordlists file path in chk.json under the path key that is already setup for you.
The default path wordlist is the example one in the folder. The wordlist can be anywhere on your pc.
